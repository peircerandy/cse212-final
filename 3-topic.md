# Trees

<!-- Introduction -->
## Introduction
Trees are a data type? Yep! Just think about it. A tree starts with its trunk, then splitting of from the  truck are its branches, there could just be one, two or many branches splitting from the trunk, then each branch in turn can also have a few or many branches splitting from them until, and this continues for branch off of a branch until we finally have a small branch called a **leaf** that has no branches. Each branch can contain a little information on it and then it directs you to the branches that split from it. A well know n example of the tree data structure would be a family tree. Your ancestors are closer to the trunk of the tree, their children are branches off of them, their children each have children branching off from them, until it gets to your parents and then you. If you don't have any kids then that makes you a _leaf_.

## Common Uses
- Decision trees. Each each branch represents a different decision that could be made with certain decisions leading to different future decisions.Often used in Artificial intelligence programs such as video game NPCs. 
- File Systems. On Windows the C drive is the **root** node (first node in the tree) and each file is a **child**, or branch of it. 
- Binary Search Trees (BST). Used to quickly find, insert, and delete sorted data. It is much faster to find a data item from a BST than from a linked list because it doesn't have to traverse through each item. 

<!-- Operations -->
## Operations and Performance
Trees are very similar to [linked lists](2-topic.md). Trees, like liked lists, also use **nodes** to represent data. Each node contains a variable  for the data, a variable that links to its **parent** node (the node it branches from), and a variable with a link for each of its branches.
