# Queues
<!--Introduction-->
Amusment parks are fun places to visit.They have fun rides and good food, but there is one thing amusment parks have that nobody likes: _the **lines**_. Maybe if you're fast and get to a ride just after the park opened, you can get there before anyone else and you won't have to wait very long. But, if you're not so lucky you will have to wait for everyone who got to the ride before you to have their turn before you can get on the ride. We could also call these lines `queues`.
<!-- Definitions -->
## Definition
Queues are an ordered sequence of entities or data items where the entities are added to one side, what we call the `back`, and removed from the other side, what we call the `front`. This process is typically reffered to as the **First In, First Out** (`FIFO`) rule.

Other important terms to remember are `enqueue` and `dequeue`. **Enqueuing** is what the process fror adding entities to the back of a queue is called and **Dequeuing** is what the process for removing entities from the front of the queue is called.
