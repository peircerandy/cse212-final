# Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the Data Structures Tutorial. Every programmer needs to know these essential data structures as they are uses frequently and are the building blocks of many programs:

- [Queues](1-topic.md)
- [Linked Lists](2-topic.md)
- [Trees](3-topic.md)

Each module will contain descriptions and examples.  At the end of each module, you will find a problem to solve on your own.  You should only look at the solution after you have attempted to solve the problem first.
